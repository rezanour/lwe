# lwe
Lightweight Engine

1. Setup & building
  lwe depends on two external repositories, glm & vulkan. In order to build, you will need to 
  clone those repositories and update the project files in this repository to point to them.
  Alternatively, you can clone them to sibling directories of lwe and not have to update anything.

  lwe supports Windows at this time, with limited (non-rendering) support for OSX.
  Windows build projects for Visual Studio are provided, as well as simple makefiles for OSX.
